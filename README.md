# How To Use It

1. Set your Transparency to 0-255. 255 seems original osu!, 0 seems nothing. I recommand 100-150.
2. Click the Save / Run Button.
3. If you interested in, Try thanging BG Color.
4. If Transparancy BG Window dose not fit to osu window, Try using "Custom Size Gamma" and set your X, Y, Width, Height manually.
5. If you exit, Right click this Tray Icon, and select "Exit".
6. If you change setting after Run, Right click this Tray Icon, and select "Show GUI".

# How Does It Work?

When it runs and osu! Window activated, This program get a information about osu!, and make a BG-Colored GUI underneath osu! window. And change transparent of osu! Window.
And also osu! Window deactivated, It destroy GUI and set original transparent of osu!
